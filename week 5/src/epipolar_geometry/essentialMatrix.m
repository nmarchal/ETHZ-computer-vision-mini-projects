% Compute the essential matrix using the eight point algorithm
% Input
% 	x1s, x2s 	Point correspondences 3xn matrices
%
% Output
% 	Eh 			Essential matrix with the det F = 0 constraint and the constraint that the first two singular values are equal
% 	E 			Initial essential matrix obtained from the eight point algorithm
%

function [Eh, E] = essentialMatrix(x1s, x2s)
